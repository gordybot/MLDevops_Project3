For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details

## Intended Use

## Training Data
Census income data extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.

## Evaluation Data

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._

## Ethical Considerations

## Caveats and Recommendations
This dataset seems pretty old. $1 in 1994 is worth ~$2.07 in 2023, and other working conditions have certainly changed.
